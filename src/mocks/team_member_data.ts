        brief: `HERE TO MAKE A STATEMENT IN THE HEART OF A TROPICAL PENINSULA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA- KATUN, HAS HONED HIS POSITION AS ONE OF THE TOP LEADING GRAFFITI ARTISTS IN MALAYSIA. A TALENTED LOCAL WHO HAS CREATED AN IDENTITY AND NAME FOR HIMSELF THROUGH HIS LOVE OF REINTERPRETING CARTOON CHARACTERS AS HIS SIGNATURE STYLE. GROWING UP IN MALAYSIA, KATUN'S QUOTIDIAN EXPOSURE TO MONKEYS AND FORESTRY IN THE REGION INITIALLY SPARKED HIS INSPIRATIONS IN CREATING HIS UNIQUE STATEMENT PIECES- HIS APES. KNOWN OF ITS ROBUST BODY FORM, KATUN HAS REDEFINED HIS APES TO TAKE A HUMANISTIC SILHOUETTE WHILE STAYING TRUE TO THE NATURAL DISJOINTED LIMBS OF THE GREAT APES THAT ARE NATIVE TO MALAYSIA- THE ORANGUTAN; TRANSLATED TO "MAN OF THE FOREST".
             TO DATE, HE HAS CREATED HIS OWN ART COLLECTIVE 4 STAGES WITH BRAND COLLABORATIONS WITH VANS, MARSHALL, NEW ERA, SONY- AND A NOTABLE ROASTER OF RENOWNED ARTISTS SUCH AS GRAMMY WINNERS CHRIS BROWN, DUA LIPA, AND POST MALONE TO NAME A FEW.
